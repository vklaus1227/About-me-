## 🛡️ About Me

With over 10 years in healthcare and a recent transition into cybersecurity, I bring a deep understanding of privacy, compliance, and secure system handling. My work in radiology involved HIPAA compliance, access control management, and incident reporting — experiences that now fuel my passion for cybersecurity.

I'm particularly interested in:
- **GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance)**
- **HIPAA & NIST-based risk assessments**
- **Security operations & vulnerability management**
